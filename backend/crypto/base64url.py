    Description:
        - This module provides cryptographic utilities including base64url encoding/decoding,
          JSON stabilisation, RSA key management, RSA encryption/decryption, and RSA signing/verification.
        - It consolidates various cryptographic functions for easy import and use across the backend.

    BASE64URL functionality

    Tested: as of 17/09/2025 @ 1:53pm
        - Verified round-trip encodeâ†’decode for b"", b"A", b"OK", b"hi", b"hello world", and b"\x00\xff\x10"
        - Verified no padding was encoded
        - Verified padding was added back correctly after decoding
        - Tested edge cases with one or more padding chars
        - Confirmed empty input encodes and decodes correctly
        - Testing bad strings raise errors.
